one-hot vector
  0 - in most dimensions
  1 - in a single dimension

training model
  define what it means for the model
    to be good
    to be bad

cost/lost
  how far off our models is from our desired outcome

minimize the error
  the smaller the error margin, the better our model is

cross-entropy
  how inefficient our predictions are for describing the truth

computation graph
  add new operations to the graph which implement  
    backpropagation algorithm
    gradient descent algorithm

steps
  load data
  build a model
  train the model
  evaluate the model
  
the model
  placeholders
  variables
  predicted class
  loss function
